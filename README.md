# i3 Dotfiles

Pretty minimal setup, currently configured for the workflow on my chromebook but will change soon.

Read through the i3 config for the keyboard shortcuts

Requires these pakages:
```
i3 (full package)
exa
feh
nitrogen
compton
papirus-icon-theme
xfce4-terminal
```

Requires from the AUR:
```
gtk-theme-arc-git
i3ipc-glib-git
polybar-git
siji-git
```

I think that's it.
